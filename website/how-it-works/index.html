            <h2> HOW IT WORKS </h2>
            <p class="hiw"> Life in Digital is made in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> which is an open-source programming language for (mainly) visual output. It uses the temboo library and choreos for Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram (Unfortunately it couldn't quite work with the limitatiosn fo the facebook). I get authorization to use their apis via temboo which then prompts the user to give further access to get more private data.</p>

            <p class="hiw">The data I'm collecting from Twitter is the number of tweets, followers, friends, messages and retweets. From tumblr, its the number of people you are following, the number of posts, number of blogs and how many followers those blogs have, number of likes and from instagram, the number of posts, followers and following. I then combine all this data (even though it would still be visible somewhere on the screen to determine the height of the line tracing and to drive the animation. All my code is available on <a href="https://github.com/oa495/Life-in-digital">github</a></p>
