            <h2> ABOUT </h2>
            <p class="about">This project explores the idea of living on social media. Are you active? Are you alive? Are you literally living on social media? Social media is something that has come and taken over a huge part of our lives in a way. Now there is no shortage of data or infographics or visualizations about the impact social media has on users or what social media platforms are dominating. The problem I found was that The problem with this is the focus on users not humans. All this data we see is generalized. Instead of I spent “this amount of time” doing “this specific thing” on Facebook, it's USERS spent an average of 8 hours on twitter daily or Twitter’s fastest growing demographic is 55 to 64 years old. It’s easy when dealing with data for an individual to become a statistic. Which I think is a shame because we spend a lot of time online now. It’s real and important. And it can be damaging if you’re not careful. So what do we do? How do we explore this relationship we have with the web? </p>

            <p class="about">Life in Digital was an idea that came to me while I was brainstorming for an idea for my Interaction Design class at NYU POLY. I held on to it because I thought it was cool. But more than that I think I held on to it because it is a connection that is already made in our lives: social media and living. Not only is it cool to see your tweets and your facebook posts as line tracings in an electrocardiograph but it also makes you think about how much social media is a part of your life and how much you want it to. </p>
