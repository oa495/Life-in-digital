            <h2> ABOUT </h2>
            <p class="about">It matters. I think. How much time we spend, what we do on social media. For reasons you may share with me and others you may not. I am certainly not one of those people who can give up social networks because so much of what I do (in school and otherwise) is entwined with that. But I don't want to be spending hours upon hours on Facebook - especially at the demise of actual, human relationships. So what do I do? What do we do to explore this relationship we have with the web? </p>

            <p class="about">Life in Digital was an idea that came to me while I was brainstorming for an idea for my Interaction Design class at NYU Poly. I held on to it because I thought it was interesting and cool and a metaphor waiting to happen. I mean "living on social media?", "active on social media?" It was gold. But more than that I think I held on to it because it is important. Not only is it cool to see your tweets and your facebook posts as line tracings in an electrocardiograph but it also makes you think about how much social media is a part of your life and how much you want it to. </p>

            <p class="about">I have tried unsuccessfully many times to "take a break from social media." But I think that was the wrong approach. I need normal healthy doses as I am sure many others do. I hope this project will help you get there. </p>
